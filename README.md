# self-driving-amazon-box

This repo will include all the files for my Self Driving Amazon Box.

I plan on using building it with Arduino chips and parts mostly printed on my 3D printer.

## Parts

### 3D Printed
I am using Fusion 360 to build the parts. They are all in the /self-driving-amazon-box-parts.step file
- Shaft
- Engine bed

### Electronics
- [Arduino Uno](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/)
- Slow RPM brushless DC motor [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Acxico-Micro-Motor-3V-6V-Gearbox/dp/B09DG3GCGK)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/WWZMDiB-HC-SR04-Ultrasonic-Distance-Measuring/dp/B0B1MJJLJP)

### Code
This is the code you need to upload to the Arduino.
